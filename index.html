      <p>
      Thanks for everything...<br>
      I'm writing to rewind a memoir we both played,<br>
      <br>
      The reason I got attached to you so soon, is because you made me feel something after being numb for so long...<br>
      <br>
      Then out of blue moon you bloomed in my mind...<br>
      It was the time when we had 3 different convos on 3 different apps, :)<br>
      <br>
      I felt overjoyed,<br>
      when you reacted for the hifi emoji I used to send, ЁЯЩМ<br>
      it would be like a heart in the middle of both hands...<br>
      <br>
      I chased over my phone, for every snap's notification...<br>
      <br>
      "You are still my favorite notification :)"<br>
      <br>
      * Those were times you did not show any excuses to message me.<br>
      * Those were times, we had a lot in common and people called it a match of wavelengths and great sync...<br>
      тАв The literal thing is the red bag we both used to carry to our home...<br>
      тАв The snap's chat "роУроУроУроУроУ"<br>
      тАв The call you made a call to get the water bottle and I was already there to get one for you...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      * I slowly revived my mind from a routine 10 o clock sleep to become<br>
      a normal human who also would get to be loved even after 10 o clock<br>
      * Those were times when we sit opposite to each other in the office and still send the snaps.<br>
      * I used to stare the most times at you and have made few eye contacts,<br>
      * I have locked the Florence of Jiya underneath my yellow heart<br>
      which smoothly turned red and out of no where it vanished...<br>
      * There are a lot secrets, I kept inside me, locked them<br>
      and the key was thrown into the deep shallow sea...<br>
      * Those were times I really felt, why the night ages, I hoped the nights would prolong forever...<br>
      * Those were times when we know it is already time and we didn't hold the call...<br>
      * Those were times when the call ends every 14 th min and we both<br>
      tried calling again each time continuous for 3 hours and more...<br>
      * Those were times, when every time the call ends 1.30 hrs and<br>
      we redial and it again ends 1.30 hrs and still redialled to say good night...<br>
      <br>
      Look at us now, the phone at night wants to dial you bad.<br>
      <br>
      So then,<br>
      "I used to have late night conversations with the Moon,<br>
      She tells me about the Sun,<br>
      I tell her about you..."<br>
      <br>
      That both had left us at night ...<br>
      <br>
      * Those were times, i was afraid to ask you out with me on the bike, and although we had been in the steel bird for 4 long times near the office<br>
      <br>
      Memories that are still pounding my heart,<br>
      * The little coffee we had at aruvi.<br>
      * The wobbly 1 hr Jeep ride up and down seated that close<br>
      and those four selfies still rule my gallery...<br>
      * The funny/embarrassing dance performance i made in front of you<br>
      inside the traveler.<br>
      The whole return journey i was near you, watching the movies scratching our shoulders.<br>
      * The evening cricket we played together<br>
      * Shuttle games we team-up each 7PM<br>
      * The snaps you used to send when you reach your hostel<br>
      and I really waited for it every day<br>
      * I usually wait from 10 am to 10.15 am outside the EIE department casually for someone to arrive, :)<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      At the end of my sister's engagement function, you all had boarded my friend's auto,<br>
      i hoped you would give your final glimpse after getting inside, and that really happened :)<br>
      <br>
      I hope you remember you, giving a slanted glimpse at the end.<br>
      <br>
      I found that a lot can happen over a tiny dimple,<br>
      Which gave birth to the quote,<br>
      <br>
      "She took away<br>
      the only left glimpses of her<br>
      Right dimple..."<br>
      <br>
      "I forget what my dream was about<br>
      I remember calling your name"<br>
      <br>
      I wasn't normal, after not being as normal as we were when we were in kvp office/ after office times.<br>
      <br>
      "Loosing a good friend is not happy,<br>
      Especially when you don't understand why you lost them in first place..."<br>
      <br>
      Now tell me, how did you move on<br>
      as if these are normal and happened only to me?<br>
      These are etched in my mind as it is sculptured on stones<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
      .<br>
      "I didn't mean to fall in love, but you made it easy for me...тЭдя╕ПтАНЁЯФе<br>
      Thanks for being this long..."<br>
